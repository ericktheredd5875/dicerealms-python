- [ ] Turn status messages
- [ ] Error messages

### Turn-Based System
- [ ] Turn manager (track current player, enforce order)
- [ ] Action announcement system
  - [ ] Broadcast action before execution
  - [ ] All clients receive and display announcement
- [ ] Synchronized waiting/animation
  - [ ] Server-side delay (2 seconds for dramatic effect)
  - [ ] Client-side spinner/progress indicators
  - [ ] All clients wait together
- [ ] Action execution and result broadcasting
  - [ ] Server processes action
  - [ ] Broadcast result to all clients
  - [ ] All clients display result simultaneously
- [ ] Turn advancement
  - [ ] Next player selection
  - [ ] Turn status updates

### UI Integration
- [ ] Rich console integration
  - [ ] Action announcement panels
  - [ ] Result display panels
  - [ ] Player list tables
  - [ ] Room information display
  - [ ] Chat message formatting
- [ ] prompt-toolkit integration
  - [ ] Input handling with history
  - [ ] Command autocomplete
  - [ ] Turn-based input enabling/disabling
  - [ ] Multi-line input support
- [ ] Synchronized animations
  - [ ] Spinner during action execution
  - [ ] Progress indicators
  - [ ] Visual feedback for all players

### Messaging System
- [ ] Chat commands (say, whisper)
- [ ] System messages (player joins, leaves, etc.)
- [ ] Message broadcasting to room
- [ ] Private messaging (whisper)

### Testing
- [ ] Unit tests for server components
- [ ] Unit tests for client components
- [ ] Integration tests (2+ clients connected)
- [ ] Synchronization tests (verify all clients see actions)
- [ ] Turn management tests
- [ ] Connection/disconnection tests

### Documentation
- [ ] Architecture design document
- [ ] Message protocol specification
- [ ] Server setup guide
- [ ] Client usage guide
- [ ] Multiplayer examples

➡️ [View details in `M3.md`](./docs/milestones/M3.md)  
➡️ [Architecture Design Document](./docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) *(to be created)*

**Key Success Criteria:**
- ✅ Two players can connect simultaneously
- ✅ When Player1 acts, Player2 sees announcement BEFORE execution
- ✅ Both players see synchronized spinner/wait during action
- ✅ Both players see result simultaneously
- ✅ Turn-based: only current player can input commands
- ✅ Rich UI renders beautifully on both clients
