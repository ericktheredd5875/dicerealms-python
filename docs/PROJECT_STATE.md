Current focus: **[Milestone M1]**

> **Naming note:** The Python package directory is **`dicerealms/`** (no underscore).

## Modules & Responsibilities

### dicerealms/core.py
- **Purpose:** Core mechanics (dice rolls, randomization utilities).
- **Functions:**
  - `roll_dice(dice: str) -> int` – roll dice uses regex ("(\d+)d(\d+)") to parse dice type and quantity.
- **Notes:** Utility functions, stateless.

### dicerealms/console_frontend.py
- **Purpose:** A simple console frontend that:
    - renders output with a write(str) callback
    - reads input lines in a background task
    - forwards lines to the GameSession
- **Classes:**
  - `ConsoleFrontend`
    - `__init__()`
    - `_write(text: str)`
    - `async start()`
    - `async _stdin_reader()`
    - `async def run()`
- **Notes:** I don't like the current naming convention for this file/class. Maybe it needs to be changed to console.py??.

### dicerealms/player.py
- **Purpose:** Player representation, stats, and inventory.
- **Classes:**
  - `Player`: dataclass
    - `name: str = "Adventurer"`
    - `room: str = "Town Square"`
- **Notes:** Player data is central, persisted later in M4.

### dicerealms/world.py
- **Purpose:** Defines rooms and realms, navigation logic.
- **Classes:**
  - Nothing Yet
- **Notes:** Placeholder world now, will expand in M2 & M4.

### dicerealms/engine.py
- **Purpose:** Orchestrates basic command handling.
- **Classes:**
  - `Engine`
    - `__init__(player: Player | None = None)`
    - `handle(line: str) -> str`
- **Notes:** Will eventually split into networking vs CLI engines.

### dicerealms/session.py
- **Purpose:** Orchestrates the game loop.
  - A single player's session: reads commands from an input queue, passess them
    to the Engine, and writes responses via a callback.
- **Classes:**
  - `GameSession`
    - `__init__(write_callback)`
    - `async start()`
    - `async _run()`
    - `async feed_line(line: str)`
    - `async wait_closed()`
- **Notes:** Not sure where this is going yet.

### dicerealms/__init__.py
- **Purpose:** Package exports, version.
- **Notes:** Placeholder.

### dicerealms/__main__.py
- **Purpose:** CLI entrypoint hook???
- **Functions:**
  - `async main()` – starts the 'run' command in ConsoleFrontend.
- **Notes:** Thin wrapper.

## Testing
- `tests/test_core.py` → covers dice rolling.
- Future: add `tests/test_player.py`, `tests/test_world.py`.

---

## CLI / Interaction
- Framework: **Typer**
- Command entrypoint: `python -m dicerealms`
- Current commands:
  - `play` → starts the local game loop
- Planned/Upcoming commands:
  - `server` → run server for multiplayer
  - `connect` → connect via WebSocket
  - `start` → alias for `play` (TBD)

---

## Networking
_Current state: Not implemented_  
Planned options: WebSocket (primary), Telnet (optional).

---

## Milestones
- **M1:** Basic single-player loop with dice rolling + room navigation  
- **M2:** Multiplayer support (WebSocket server)  
- **M3:** Persistence (saving characters/world state)  
- **M4:** Advanced features (combat, NPCs, items, etc.)

---

## Notes & Conventions
- License: MIT (with possible future Apache-2.0 switch)  
- Code style: `ruff` for linting  
- Tests: `pytest`  

---

## Recent Changes
_A running log to avoid confusion between sessions. Add newest entries at the top._

- **2025-08-28** — Created `PROJECT_STATE.md` with sections for structure, modules, CLI, networking, milestones, and conventions; added **Recent Changes** section. Made sure all file structure was currently active and the **Modules & Responsibilities** section has an accurate break down of what each file does currently, with method/function signatures.  
  _Author:_ Eric Harris

**How to update this section quickly**
1. Run a short tree dump when structure changes:
   ```bash
   tree -L 2 dicerealms/
   ```
2. Paste only the changed lines (or file additions) below the date.
3. If behavior changed (e.g., new CLI command), add a one-liner.

---

## Open Questions
- Do we support both CLI and WebSocket from the start?  
- Do we need persistence in M1 or wait until M3?  

---

## Refresh Cheatsheet (for quick context in chat)
- Paste this one-liner to recap focus:
  ```
  Current focus: M1 — single-player loop (dice + rooms); package dir: dicerealms; CLI: python -m dicerealms play
  ```
- Paste a short tree dump when structure matters:
  ```
  tree -L 2 dicerealms/
  ```
