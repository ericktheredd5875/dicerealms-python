# 🎲 DiceRealms (Python)

**DiceRealms** is a modern, **multiplayer, turn-based** MUD-style roleplaying platform with beautiful terminal UIs. Built for immersive text-based storytelling, synchronized group adventures, and D&D-style dice mechanics.

Players connect via WebSocket to a shared game server, where actions are announced to all players, executed with synchronized animations, and results are broadcast simultaneously. Each player enjoys a rich terminal experience powered by **Rich** (output) and **prompt-toolkit** (input).

This project is in active development. Current milestone: **M2 — Gameplay Basics**.

**Quick Start (Single-Player)**

```bash
# Run the game
python -m dicerealms

# Or use the CLI
dicerealms startalms server --port 8765

# Terminal 2: Connect as Player 1

## Multiplayer Flow Example:

### All players see this when Alice rolls:
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│ 🎲 Alice is rolling 2d6...      │
│ [Spinner animation - 2 seconds]│
└─────────────────────────────────┘

### Then all players see:
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│ Action Result                         │
│ Player:  Alice                  │
│ Action:  🎲 Roll Dice           │
│ Expression:  2d6                │
│ Result:  7                      │
│ Rolls:  [3, 4]                  │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
